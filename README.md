# üî¢ Java Console Calculator (OOP + Loops)

This is a simple console-based calculator built using **Java**. It demonstrates core programming concepts like **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **loops**, **methods**, and **user input handling** using the `Scanner` class.

## üìå Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Uses a loop to allow multiple calculations until the user exits
- Gracefully handles divide-by-zero errors
- Clean modular design using classes and methods
- Interactive console input/output

## üß† Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **OOP**              | Encapsulated logic in a `Calculator` class |
| **Methods**          | Separate methods for each operation |
| **Loops**            | `while` loop for repeated execution |
| **Conditionals**     | `switch-case` for operator selection |
| **Scanner I/O**      | Reads user input from console |
| **Error Handling**   | Prevents divide-by-zero crashes |
